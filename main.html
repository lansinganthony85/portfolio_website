            <h1>Hi, I'm Anthony</h1>
            <p>
                I got tired of reading medical reports and arguing with doctors so I went back to school and got an Associate’s
                 in Computer Science. I’ve built games, mp3 players, and even remote-controlled cars and I am excited to dive 
                 into a new career!
            </p>

        <section id="about_section">
            <p>I’m an aspiring software engineer with a decade of experience in writing and editing. I often felt like a square peg 
                trying to force myself through a round hole so I left the  industry to start fresh on a new career path. After 
                graduating summa cum laude with an Associate of Science degree in Computer Science, I am ready to hit the ground running 
                with a renewed passion.</p>
            <p>When I am not writing code or learning new skills, I enjoy hikes with my family, tennis, and playing Dungeons and Dragons.</p>
